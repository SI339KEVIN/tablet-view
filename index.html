                                socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.

                                Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat
                                snacks
                                and
                                treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find
                                him
                                playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or
                                cooling
                                off in the garage.

                                He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell,
                                Cooky
                                gets
                                really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high
                                when
                                he’s
                                hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just
                                as
                                much
                                as he likes to play.
